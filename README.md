## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Warner Bros. Discovery should look beyond the use of AI in streaming and use AI to enhance its studio tour business. Warner Bros. Discovery runs three "Warner Bros. Studio Tour " locations, in the UK, Burbank, and Tokyo. The use of AI in amusument parks is a strategy that Disney alreay uses, and this strategy could be extended to studio tours.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

According to Forbes "AI is turning amusement parks into realms of personalized adventure. Through AI-driven data analysis, parks can now tailor experiences based on visitor preferences, past visits, and even real-time decisions." 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Use of facial recognition technology to analyze faces and emotions, as well as the use iof AI in stoytelling. Warner Bros. Discovery could continue to use Flyte and Python in implemetn=ing this strategy.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Facial recognition, with analysis of emotions, can be used to deternine how customers are enjoying its tours, as well as analyze customer behavior in the gift shops. The tour and gift shop management can then make adjustments based on a better understanding of buying patterns and cutomer behavior. Disney, in their gift shops, is using AI to manage inventory and personalize recommendations, and Warner Bros. Discovery could also do this. By using AI, Warner Bros. Doscovery can better tailor its stories and cutomer experiences to its audience.
